      traces to analyze and record timings of the interaction.

    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <p>
      I'll be the first to admit these tests will not hold up to scientific scrutiny. For one, I
      wrote the app for each framework being tested, and I'm no expert with any of them. There are
      at least two concerns. One is utilizing each framework to maximize performance. The other
      being the most desired idiomatic representation of the specific framework's code. I addressed
      neither concern. Instead, I built each app to be as similar as possible with a minimalist
      approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each app was built to output identical HTML structure and request the same CSS file. Timings
      were averaged out of 12 runs throwing out the lowest two scores.
    </p>
    <p>
      The apps were built to simply create, update, or delete HTML Table element rows. I acknowledge
      these actions are far from what most robust client-side applications require.
    </p>
    <h3>Environment</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)</li>
      <li>2.5GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7 Processor</li>
      <li>16GB 1600 MHz DDR3 Memory</li>
      <li>Chrome version - HeadlessChrome/86.0.4240.0</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>
      One of the featured frameworks is
      <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/tostaylo/rust-fel" target="_blank"
        >rust-fel</a
      >
      (Rust Front-End-Library). I produced this library as an experiment. Front-End Framework Bench
      was an avenue to satisfy my curiosity on how it compared to other client-side
      library/frameworks.
    </p>

      Front-End Framework Bench was inspired by
